####Knowledgebase and Downtime Forms

#####Overview:

The Knowledgebase is a centralized repository of client information with answers to frequently asked questions.  It will be utilized by Interviewers, QA/Escalations team, SOD, Trainers, and Supervisors.

This application also gives a way to create Downtime Forms and forward them to the dissemination team when the system is being updated.

#####Purpose:

  • The Knowledgebase will evolve with every question and answer which will assist in meeting business needs/goals by providing consistent and accurate information and reports for our clients.
  • Assist in decreasing AHT and ACW. As more answers are more easily accessible, Interviewers will spend less time putting customers on hold and calling the Answer-line or searching for information through a mountain of emails.
  • Allow the QA/Escalations team and SOD to focus more on QA and Escalation tasks
  • As the Knowledgebase evolves it should replace the Answer-line with the exception of new, unique, and undocumented cases.
